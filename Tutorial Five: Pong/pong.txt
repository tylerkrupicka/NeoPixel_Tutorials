Five: pong

make a single pixel light up and bounce back and forth (like pong)

Hints:

Youll have to toggle forward and backward to go back and forth
youll either need to set the pixel behind or in front to black so that only one pixel is lit (no wipe effect)
I recommend modifying wipe to make the effect

pong2

edit your program to make the speed change based on which pixel is lit.

(edit two lines)
