Four: Ripple

Create the ripple effect (random point outward expanding) that we made first.
Choose a random number, use print to print it.
Alternate between two set colors to ripple over the top of each other.

Hints:

youll need to toggle between color one or two each loop cycle
generate a random number
create two variables to go either direction
use a loop to move outwards
dont exceed the limits of the strip

This one is much more difficult so i recommend writing it out and working one piece at a time.
